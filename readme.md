# This script was initially created to filter the shapefile for my tableau project.

# Since I am stepping down from my position in the current-time-of-writing company, I need to make a documentation.

# The original shapefile itself has been uploaded to the company's DB. So I only need to take it from DB.

# Make sure you change the SA location to whatever it is located on your local.

# Also change the query to suit your needs according to your DB.

# That's it. Goodbye!
